</li></ul>

<h2> The Bakery</h2>

A bakery with <em>NS</em> servers (shop attendants) can service
<em>NC</em> customers. It serves buns, with at most <em>NB</em>
buns being served in a single transaction.
It can do this fairly by dispensing tickets
(numbered 0,1, 2,...) in the order of their number.
An incoming customer (with customer number <em>c</em>) 
<b>take</b>s a ticket, then the next available 
server (with the server number <em>s</em>)
<b>call</b>s the number <en>t of next ticket to be served.
Customer <em>c</em> then <b>pay</b>s server <em>s</em> for <em>b</em>
buns, presenting the ticket <em>t</em> as s/he does so.
Server <em>s</em> then gives the <em>b</em> <b>bun</b>s to customer 
<em>c</em>.

<p>

For the ticket dispensing part of the system, it can be noted that
ticket numbers can be reused after every <em>NC</em> tickets are
dispensed. For example if <em>NC=3</em> and the following sequence of
tickets:

</p><ul><tt>0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1
<font color="green">2 0</font></tt>
</ul>

was dispensed so far, with two green tickets taken but not yet called,
ticket
<tt><font color="green">2</font></tt> would be the next to
be called, and ticket <tt><font color="green">0</font></tt>
to be called after that. 

<h2> System Description </h2>


<p>

<em>Simple system.</em>
This is for the simple case of <em>NC=2, NS=1, NB &#8804; 2</em>.
Ticket reuse will be necessary for the modelling part of 
the assignment (to keep the number of states manageable),
but is optional for the implementation.

</p><p>

<em>Intermediate system (part 1).</em> The model (FSP) should be able
to handle the case <em>NC &#8804; 3, NS &#8804; 2, NB &#8804; 2</em> (at least),
and the implementation should have no particular restrictions on these
parameters (note: for testing this level in FSP, keep <em>NB=1</em>,
to keep the number of actions manageable). 

</p><p>

<em>Intermediate system (part 2).</em> 

The above scenario assumes the servers have an infinite supply of buns
to give to customers. We will extend the system so that a server at
any time has <em>0 &#8804; b &#8804; NB</em> buns (initially
<em>b = NB)</em>; if a customer <b>pay</b>s for 
<em>b' &gt; b</em> buns, the
server must wait for a <b>topup</b> from a cook (who has an infinite
supply). After this, the server has
<em>NB</em> buns, and can proceed with the giving of 
<em>b'</em> <b>bun</b>s 
(note: for testing in FSP, keep <em>NC &#8804; 2</em>).
It is optional whether the <b>topup</b>s occur only at the time of
giving buns or at any time. <br>

<font color="blue">The Bakery management are becoming concerned that
some of the customers might be misusing the ticket dispensing part of
the system, i.e. taking more than 1 ticket before paying, or
presenting a ticket which they didn't take. Specify an
FSP <tt>property</tt> that asserts that the customers are not doing
that, and a composition with that property that verifies this (and
thus reassure the management!).  In your implementation, the (bakery)
monitor should also check this (and other kinds of correct customer behavior).
</font>

</p><p>

<em>Extended System.</em> 

As well as being temperamental, cooks are notorious for being unfair!
Our bakery's cook is no exception, being quite capable of starving
some of the servers (not to mention their unfortunate customers!).
Specify FSP <em>progress properties</em> that each server will
eventually get a <b>topup</b>, and write an FSP composition that shows
that (using <em>action priority</em>) that this system does indeed
violate progress.  Extend the system to provide a solution to this
problem. Show that this system does not violate the progress
property.


</p><h2> Requirements </h2>

You submission must include the following:
<ul>

<li> The <underline>plain text</underline> file
     called <tt>ReadMe.txt</tt>, created from
     the <a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/ReadMe.txt">following template file</a>, with the
     requested information filled in, including a disclaimer.  Note
     that significant contributions may require a revision of your
     final mark, as this is intended to be an individual assignment.


<p>

</p></li><li> an FSP file called <tt>Bakery.lts</tt> containing a description
     of your model.  The model should be free from deadlock and
     (without action priority) be able to make progress.  You make
     find the <a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/ModellingHints.html"> hints for large(ish) FSP
     programs</a> helpful.

<p>

</p></li><li> a file called <tt>Bakery.java</tt>; this contains a 
definition of the <tt>Bakery</tt> class, which has the 
<tt>main()</tt> method to start the system. Classes for the components
of your system  may be put in this file or in files separately submitted.
<p>

After the command <tt>javac Bakery.java</tt>
<font color="blue">(clarifiaction: it must compile 
correctly from the same directory as where the file is, i.e. <em>not</em>
be embedded in a sub-directory within some package)</font>, the command:
</p><ul><tt>
java -ea Bakery [-c] [-f] [<em>NC</em>] [<em>NS</em>]  [<em>NB</em>] 
</tt></ul>
should run the simulation with <em>NC</em> customers (default value 2)
and <em>NS</em> servers (default value 1) and <em>NB</em> as the bun
limit (default value 2). If <tt>-c</tt> was specified, the system
has a cook topping up the buns; if <tt>-f</tt> was specified,
the cook should top-up the servers in some fair fashion.

<p>
<tt>main()</tt> must create a object from the
provided <tt>BakeryParam</tt> class, which will obtain the simulation's
parameters from the command line and shell environment variables. It
must similarly create an object from the provided <tt>BakeryEvent</tt>
class.


</p><p>

Each customer must be implemented by a separate thread (more threads
can be optionally used for other parts of the system). </p><p>

When your code completes an <em>action</em> (from your FSP model), it
must signify this by calling the corresponding event logging method in
the provided <tt>BakeryEvent</tt> class.  The  <tt>sleepEvents()</tt> method
should be used for sleep of random intervals after each of these.
To achieve both variability and reproducibility with
randomly generated values, you should either use
the <tt>BakeryParam</tt>'s <tt>getRandVal()</tt> method or its
random number seed directly to seed your own generator. 

</p><p>

Your implementation should follow the <a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/MonitorGuidelines.html">
General Guidelines for Writing Monitors</a>

</p></li></ul>

Lines in all 3 files should be formatted to a standard width of 80
characters.  Your model and implementation files should follow
standard programming style conventions.  In particular neat and
consistent code layout and adequate commenting in both are important.

<p>

Your implementation may attempt any of the three levels of the system; 
please only submit for marking the code for the highest level. 
Marks will be allocated to the system levels approximately as follows:
<table>
<tbody><tr><th align="LEFT">System</th> <th>COMP2310</th> <th>COMP6310</th>  
</tr><tr><td><em>Simple<em></em></em></td> <td>60</td>  <td>50</td> </tr>
<tr><td><em>Intermediate I</em> </td><td>80</td>  <td>70</td> </tr>
<tr><td><em>Intermediate II</em></td> <td>100</td> <td>90</td>  </tr>
<tr><td><em>Extended</em></td> <td>100</td> <td>100</td> </tr>
</tbody></table>

The model and implementation code do not have to be at the same level
(in which case this should be explained in <tt>ReadMe.txt</tt>); there
will be approximate weighting of 1/3 for the model and 2/3 for the
implementation (except for the Extended level, where they will be 50%
each).  A model/implementation at a particular level with serious
flaws/bugs is unlikely to score more marks for code attempted at a
higher level.

</p><p> 

</p><h2> Bakery Parameter and Event Classes </h2>

The <tt>BakeryParam</tt> class will provide some ways of controlling the
simulation.  You can adjust these values in the shell
which you run your program from, e.g. for the Bash shell:

<ul><tt>
export BakerySeed=50; java -ea Bakery
</tt></ul>

This will enable repeatability in random number generation between
runs, which may be helpful when debugging. To return to default
behavior:

<ul><tt>
unset BakerySeed
</tt></ul>

in which case, the random seed will be time dependent. Other
environment variables used by this class are <tt>BakeryMaxEvent</tt>
(this will cause termination after this number of events are recorded)
and <tt>BakerySleepMax</tt> (which sets the maximum sleep time
in <tt>BakeryEvent.sleepEvents()</tt>), and <tt>BakeryNoGui</tt>
(suppresses the Bakery GUI when set).

<p>

The interface for the  <tt>BakeryParam</tt> class is:
</p><pre>public BakeryParam(String[] args); // args as from main(String[] args)
int  getNC(); int getNS(); int getNB();  // returns corresponding parameter
bool useCook();      // returns if a cook tops up the buns
bool fairCook();     // returns if a cook tops up with some fairness policy
long getRandSeed();  // returns a random seed for the game
int  getRandVal(int max); // returns a random number in 0..max-1
</pre>

The `interface' for the class <tt>BakeryEvent</tt> class is as follows:
<pre>BakeryEvent(BakeryParam bakP); 
// log respective actions + their parameters in a consistent format    
void logTake(int custId, int ticketNum);
void logCall(int serverId, int ticketNum);
void logPay(int custId, int serverId, int ticketNum, int numBuns);
void logBun(int custId, int serverId, int numBuns);
void logTopup(int serverId);
void logOtherEvent(String eventDescription);
void sleepEvents(); // sleep for some random time in 0..SleepMax-1 ms
</pre>


For working externally, you can get a <a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/Bakery.zip">zip
file</a> for such auxiliary class files and other files needed for the
system.  It also contains a <a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/GuiReadMe.txt">readme
file</a>, which contains instructions for using the GUI and for
working externally.  On the CS student system, an up-to-date
version of the compiled files will be available through
your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> environment and you will not need the zip
file there.



<h2>Implementation in Languages Other then Java</h2>

This may be difficult but is not out of the question - see
