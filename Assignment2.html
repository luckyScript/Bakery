<p>

</p><h2> Objectives </h2>
<ul>

<li> To implement a concurrent algorithm using two Posix-based
     concurrency architectures: forks and sockets (or other form of
     IPC).

</li><li> To gain experience in using the message-passing paradigm with a
     rendezvous-like client server interaction, and be able to contrast
     it the with the shared object / monitor paradigm.

</li><li> To gain experience in Posix system calls and libraries related
towards communication and concurrency, including using appropriate
defensive programming methods.

</li></ul>

<p>

</p><h2> Requirements </h2>

You are required to implement the Bakery simulation
of <a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/Assignment1.html">Assignment 1</a> where the system
components, both active and passive, are implemented using separate
Unix processes which communicate by passing messages.  There must be
an active process for each customer and the cook.  The passive process
corresponds to the bakery monitor.
<p>

The active processes send <em>action request</em> messages to the
monitor process, which receives these requests.  It may
need to defer a particular request until the bakery state is ready to
perform it (this corresponds to <em>condition synchronization</em>
in the message passing paradigm). 
When the bakery state is ready to accept the action,
the monitor process must make the corresponding call to the provided 
<a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/bakeryState.h">BakeryState function</a> (for Java, 
<a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/BakeryState.html">BakeryState method</a>),
which updates the bakery's state and logs the action.
Action parameters decided by the monitor process (e.g. ticket numbers,
server ids and number of buns received) must then be communicated
back to the respective active process(es) (as an <em>action reply</em>).
The monitor process may assume the active processes make action
requests in their proper sequence.

</p><p>

Your main program has the same command line synopsis as for Assignment
1 (the <tt>-f</tt> option is no longer relevant and may be ignored)
and it must call the initialization functions in the
<a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/bakeryParam.h">BakeryParam</a> and  
<a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/bakeryState.h">BakeryState</a> modules
(for Java, it should construct a <tt>BakeryParam</tt> object (as per
Assignment 1), and pass that object to the <a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/BakeryState.html">
BakeryState</a> constructor).
It should then create all required processes and begin the simulation.
It may use the C <a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/socketWrapper.h">SocketWrapper</a> library
(especially if using sockets for IPC).
</p><p>

The <tt>BakeryState</tt> module will terminate the calling (monitor)
process when the required number of events are logged. However it will
not terminate the other (active) processes: these must terminate
themselves when an attempt to read an <em>action reply</em> fails.

</p><p> 

Your system should follow <a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/MonitorGuidelines.html">
General Guidelines for Writing Monitors</a> (read `process' for
`thread') with respect to sleeps between actions and desirable action
interleavings.  For full marks, your system should also minimize the
number of useless topup actions, i.e. the cook attempts to topup a
server who already has <em>NB</em> buns.


</p><p>
Please note the following for your program:
</p><ul>

<li> It will be tested on a 4-core Linux machine like those in the CS
student labs, and it must work on those machines! <br>
<font color="blue">Clarification: the <tt>bakeryAnalyzer </tt> tool
will be used to determine correctness, both for detection of
undesired behaviour (incorrect event values or sequences - if not 
already detected by BakeryState) and showing evidence of desirable 
behavior (indicated by
the reported statistics).
</font>

</li><li> It should be written with good programming style (C code should
not produce any warnings when compiled with the <tt>-Wall</tt>
option!). It should be adequately commented and formatted to a
standard width of 80 characters, so as to enable the reader (this
includes your tutor/marker!) to easily read it.  A standard
indentation of 2 or 4 spaces should also be used.  Identifiers
should be meaningful and (unless their role is trivial) commented
where declared, any constants should be named rather than hard-coded,
and defensive programming should be used. The latter includes checks
being made for system calls that can fail due to resource limitations
(anything that creates a file descriptor or process); once detected, a
message should be generated with a call to the system error
function <tt>perror()</tt> and the process should exit with a status
of 2. It also includes using
<tt>assert</tt> to perform other kinds of checks (including overflow
of any fixed-length data structures that you use).
Any unused file descriptors in a process should be closed as soon as possible.
Note that the <tt>BakeryState</tt> module will check 
<em>action requests</em> for validity, so it is not necessary that your
monitor process do this as well.


</li><li> Your program must have a preamble making a declaration about the
work you have submitted. The provided template files
(<a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/distBakery.c">distBakery.c</a>,
 <a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/DistBakery.java">DistBakery.java</a>) come with
such a preamble. You must add your name and student number where
indicated. If you need to modify the declaration, e.g. you did in fact
receive substantial assistance from another person who is not course staff, 
you should modify the text to say so. Code obtained from the internet
will receive no marks even if acknowledged.

</li></ul>

Marks will be allocated to   approximately as follows:
<table>
<tbody><tr><th align="LEFT">Constraint</th> <th>% mark</th> </tr>
<tr><td><em>NC = 1, NS = 1</em>, no cook</td> <td>60</td> </tr>
<tr><td><em>NC &#8804; 2 NS = 1 </em>, no cook</td> <td>70</td> </tr>
<tr><td><em>NC &#8804; 2 NS &#8804; 2</em>, no cook</td> <td> 75 </td>  </tr>
<tr><td><em>NC &#8804; 2 NS &#8804; 2</em></td> <td> 85 </td>  </tr>
<tr><td><em>no restriction</em></td> <td>100</td> </tr>
</tbody></table>

It is recommended that you develop your program in the above stages.
It is also recommended that you use fixed-length messages between
pairs of processes (e.g. a customer's <em>action request</em> might be a
structure containing action name, ticket number, server id, etc
attributes. If an attribute is not relevant to the action,
it is simply ignored when received).

<font color="blue">
<h2>The Extended BakeryParam Class</h2>

Java implementations will have to fork-exec child versions of the same
program to implement the customer etc processes. The easiest way to enable a
child instance to distinguish itself from the parent is via passing to the
child a modified command line parameter list. However the child process
still needs to know things like the value of <em>NC</em> and hence use
<tt>BakeryParam</tt> as well. To support this,
the <tt>BakeryParam</tt> module will parse command lines of the format:
<ul><tt>
java -ea DistBakery [-C <em>cid</em>] [-P <em>port</em>] [-g] [-c] [-f] 
[<em>NC</em>] [<em>NS</em>] [<em>NB</em>]
</tt></ul>

The <tt>-C</tt> and <tt>-P</tt> options should never be used to
invoke the simulation; they should only be inserted into the command
line parameter list of the child processes (before they get created).
<em>cid</em> is the id of the child process (use any convention you like
to number them)
and <em>port</em> is the port number of the listening socket of the parent.
<tt>BakeryParam</tt> has the following extra methods to the version of
Assignment 1:

<ul><pre>boolean isChild();  // returns whether the -C option was present
int getChildId();   // returns cid from the -C cid option (default -1)
int getPortNo();    // returns port from the -P port option (default 0)  
void sleepEvents(); // sleep for some random time in 0..SleepFactor-1 ms
</pre></ul>
</font>

<h2> Compilation and Running of Codes On-site</h2>

On the CS student system, you can compile your C program with the command
<ul><tt>
$ gcc -Wall -I $COMP2310/include -o distBakery distBakery.c 
$COMP2310/lib/bakery.a
</tt></ul>
If you use Java, your program must be compilable by the command
<ul><tt>
$ javac DistBakery.java 
</tt></ul>
and be able to be run by:
<ul><tt>
$ java -ea DistBakery ...
</tt></ul>

<h2> Compilation and Running of Codes Off-site</h2>

See <a href="http://courses.cecs.anu.edu.au/courses/COMP2310/assignments/Ass2Offsite.html"> this file</a>.
Suffice to say it may be tricky especially on Windoze....
